# pygame-shooter

I want to learn more about using pygame so I am doing a code along with techwithtim and learning about the code in the process. 

This 2-D game will take two ships, one on the left and one on the right, and allow you to move them both using awsd and arrow keys respectively. You'll then be able to shoot at one another and decrease the helath until one is empty and the game ends.

Here's the pygame tutorial on GitHub: https://github.com/techwithtim/PygameForBeginners
